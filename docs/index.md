# Mango

**Mango** is a python library for parallel optimization over complex search spaces. Currently, Mango is intended to find the optimal hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms.

Mango enables parallel hyperparameter tuning with the following salient features:
- Ability to easily define complex search spaces compatible with the scikit-learn.
- A state-of-the-art optimizers for continuous/discrete/categorical values.
- Modular design allows the user to schedule objective function evaluations on local, cluster,  or cloud infrastructure.
- New features are continuously added due to the testing and usage in production settings.
